    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p style="background-color: aqua; color:red; font-size:larger">SS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used for describing the presentation of a web page written in HTML. It defines how HTML elements should be displayed on a screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work because it allows developers
        to control the layout of multiple web pages simultaneously. By separating the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), it also makes maintenance and updating easier.
