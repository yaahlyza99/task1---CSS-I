    <h1>Common CSS Issues</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Specificity Problems: Styles not applying due to conflicting rules.</li>
        <li>Overlapping Styles: Styles are overridden by other styles unintentionally.</li>
        <li>Broken Layout: Elements not displaying as expected due to float or positioning issues.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Debugging Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Developer Tools: Right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or use F12.</li>
        <li>Select Element: Use the element selector in the developer tools to hover over the elements.</li>
        <li>Check CSS Styles: In the "Styles" panel, review the applied styles and overridden styles.</li>
        <li>Test Changes: Directly edit styles in the developer tools to see live changes.</li>
        <li>Identify Issues: Look for any CSS rules crossed out, indicating they are being overridden.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example Issue:</h3>
    <p>Suppose a button is styled with a background color, but it appears with a different color. Use the developer tools to inspect the button and check if another CSS rule is overriding your style.</p>
